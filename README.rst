======================
Django Crispy Un-Forms
======================

`django-crispy-unforms <https://github.com/559labs/django-crispy-unforms>`_  is
a package of additional layout objects that aren't form based. There are times
when you need to display additional fields as read-only elements in a variety
of ways. You could simply make a field disabled, but this is hugely a bad UX
practice.

Installation
------------

1. Install the package with: ``pip install django-crispy-unforms``
2. Import the module into your project:  ``import crispy_unforms``
3. Use your newly found layout objects within your Crispy form layouts.

for our Django-based projects.
